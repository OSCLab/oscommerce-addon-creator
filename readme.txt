Create MODX files from your computer without having to be online.

Basically the same creator used at http://www.phpbb.com/mods/modx-tools/creator/
but for offline usage. You need a local web server (WAMP, XAMPP) or similar running
php 5 or better. Just throw the files in a directory in your web server root, point
your browser to that directory and you are ready to make MODX install files.

Enjoy.
